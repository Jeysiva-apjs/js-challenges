# Description

1. Create a function called `getPromise` that returns a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds and returns "Resolved!".
2. Create two new functions that call `getPromise` within each
  1. In the first function, chain the returned promise with `.then` to print the resolved value.
  2. In the second function, use `async` and `await` to handle the returned Promise and printing the resolved value.
