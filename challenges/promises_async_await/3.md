# Description

1. Create a function called `doubledPromise` that takes a `number` and returns a Promise that resolves with the value of the `number` doubled.
2. Chain it three times to double the number incrementally, where each Promise depends on the previous. For example, 2 should become 8.

Create two functions:
* Using `.then` and `.catch`
* Using `async` and `await`
